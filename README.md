# Weather App with React

- Ability to show cities by hover to them which will be kept in redux (mandatory),

## API:

I worked with https://openweathermap.org/ and used their free API. In order to work with them you need to signup to get an `APIKEY`. APIKey shall be stored on serverside only. 

Get started documentation is at https://openweathermap.org/appid and we will be working with `Weather Data` API which is at https://openweathermap.org/current . This API is able to query current weather by different properties like ZIP, Coordinate or Name of the city. We will use the Name of the city as the query property. The example API Endpoint is at https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22 

## Build and Start
